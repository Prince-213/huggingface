export const gouniInfo = "History of Godfrey Okoye University The Beginning The idea of establishing a Catholic University by the Catholic Diocese of Enugu was first conceived and presented by the Emeritus Bishop of Enugu, Most Rev. Dr. A. O. Gbuji, to all priests of the diocese. He wanted a university with the name “Cor Unum”, a university that could represent the unity of all educational institutions and activities of the diocese. In spite of the effort of the bishop to see the project take off immediately, it did not. Bishop Gbuji later discussed his plan with Rev. Fr. Prof. Christian Anieke, whom he had appointed the provost of the Institute of Ecumenical Education in February 2006. Rev. Fr. Prof. Anieke understood the importance of a university in the diocese and took the bull by the horn. He assured the bishop that he would use all the resources he had to ensure that he built a university for the diocese. At a meeting in the Council Chamber of the Institute of Ecumenical Education, Thinker’s Corner, Enugu, on 9 November 2007, the convener of the meeting, Rev. Fr. Professor Christian Anieke, Provost of the Institute, informed the participants that he had applied for a university that would belong to the Catholic Diocese of Enugu. He also assured the members that he would bring all the financial resources needed for a takeoff of the project. In attendance at the meeting were: Very Rev. Fr. Prof. Christian Anieke Barr. (Mrs.) B. N. Ugwu Msgr. Prof. Obiora Ike Barr. Anthony Mogboh (SAN) Prof. Christian Nwachukwu Okeke Prof. Julius Onah Arch. C. O. Orji Rev. Mother Ifechukwu Udorah, DDL Prof. Edwin Onyeneje Engr. R. C. Odumodu Prof. Joseph Ikechukwu Chidobem Prof. Festus C. Eze The meeting was the official inauguration of the Planning and Implementation Committee (PIC), comprising the clergy, reputable public officers and experienced university administrators, some of whom had received training in the National Universities Commission and had a good knowledge of the approved guidelines for the establishment of universities in Nigeria. The Committee, with Prof. Julius Onah as chairman, met several times to brainstorm and agree on the critical issues of the vision, mission, philosophy and objectives of the proposed university and the preparation of the three strategic documents: Academic Brief, University Law and Masterplan. The Planning and Implementation Committee and its sub-committees carried out the assignment not only expeditiously but also with a high degree of commitment, inspired by the sincerity of purpose demonstrated by the Rev. Fr. Professor Christian Anieke, who provided all the logistics needed for the smooth execution of the assignments of the Committee and its subcommittees. Indeed there is always an aura of success and victory surrounding a person of goodwill, and so given his sincerity of purpose and support, the PIC with its subcommittees was ready in record time to invite the National Universities Commission Standing Committee on Private Universities (SCOPU), the NUC committee responsible for the assessment and recommendation for approval all proposed universities, for the first verification visit of the proposed university. Meanwhile, in one of the meetings, Rev. Fr. Prof. Anieke informed the members that Prof. Julius Okojie had advised him and Prof. Onah to name the university after a bishop who had worked in the diocese since the proposed university would belong to the Catholic Diocese of Enugu. They settled for Bishop Okoye, who contributed a lot to the growth of the diocese, including acquiring 95 percent of the land used as the permanent site of the university. The first name was written as Bishop Okoye Ecumenical University ( BOEcU), which was later modified as Godfrey Okoye University (GO University or, as students fondly call it, GO) . what about accreditaton?, GO University received its operational licence from the National Universities Commission (NUC) in 2009, and so commenced full academic activities in the 2009/2010.
